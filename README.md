# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to Uncover Trends

# Kickstarter Campaigns Challenge Analysis 
## Overview of the Project
### In this project, I'll be using a large fundraising campaings datasets to use effecient techniques likee pivot tables and formulas on excel, analyze the results, and propose the best conlcusions. The purpose of all of this is to help Louise in her fundraising campaign in a short period of time by making analysis and looking at some criteria like the outcomes and the launch date of other campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### According to the pivot table of the theater outcomes based on the launch date, we see that the successful campaigns are mostly 50% higher than the failed campaigns except for the months of October and December. In addition, the canceled campaigns do not exceed the 5-6% of the total campaigns that are done each month which gives Louise a great motive to engage in the theater campaign. Finally, the pivot chart shows that the most number of succesful campaigns were achieved in May. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### The goal of the fundraising campaign is a very important factor that affects the outcome, so we created a small table which divides the three different fundraising outcomes (Successful, Failure, Cancellation) into 12 goal ranges to see which range has more succeeded. Based on the chart, we can say that highest percentage of success happened when the goal was lower than $5,000 then the risky range of $35,000 and $45,000 comes in the second place. In the other ranges, the percentage of failure was exceeding the percentage of success. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### Choosing the most important factors, criteria, dates and campaigns are the most challenges while working on the analysis because they are the keys to take the best decision. However, the different analysis techniques help to narrow the large dataset.  
## Results
   - According to the numbers and the graph of the theater outcomes based on the launghing date, we can conclude that Louise shouldn't start the fundraising in the last three month of the year because the failure possibility is quite high compared to the other months. Second, the most recommended month to start is May at which the records show the highest number of successful campaigns with an average percentage of failure.  
   - If we go deap to the types of theater campaigns, we see that the Plays Theater goals are achieved at a goal of $5,000 and lower or at a goal between $35,000 and $45,000. However, the number of failed campaigns in that range was high as well, so I don't recommend it Louise. The amount of the goal depends on the goal of Louise in her campaign, but an amount of $5,000 and lower is the ebst choice for the fundraising. 
   - The limitations of the dataset are the huge number of campaigns that are taken into consideration and the different factors that affect the outcome of each campaign. 
   - Using the Box and Whisker and the measures of central tendency and spread are very important tools to help us in our analyis
